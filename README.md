# HWTA - Hansel's Way To Art

HWTA is a method for creating art based on user input. It was created by Hansel Stevan Boike as a way to help people create art using specific prompts.

## How to Use HWTA

To use HWTA, follow these steps:

1. Start by providing a simple prompt or description of what you want to create. Be specific and include only important details.
2. Find a reference image or object that is related to the prompt. Use this reference as a guide for creating the art.
3. Use the Mid Journey AI tool to help visualize and create the art based on the prompt and reference.

## Mid Journey AI

Mid Journey AI is a tool that uses natural language processing to create visual descriptions of text prompts. It can help users create more accurate and vivid art based on their prompts.

## Program Example

Here's an example program written in Python that can help users remember the HWTA method:

## An example implementation of the HWTA method
```python
import openai
import requests

# Set up the OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = "<YOUR_API_KEY>"

# Define a function to generate a Mid Journey text prompt using the HWTA method
def generate_prompt(image_url):
    # Use CLIP to get the image description
    response = requests.post("https://api.openai.com/v1/images/generations", headers={
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {openai.api_key}"
    }, json={
        "model": "image-alpha-001",
        "prompt": f"Describe the image at {image_url}",
        "num_images": 1,
        "size": "1024x1024",
        "response_format": "url"
    })
    image_description = response.json()["data"][0]["prompt"]
    
    # Use the image description to generate a Mid Journey text prompt
    prompt = f"Create a scene with {image_description}."
    
    return prompt
```

To use this program, you would need to replace <YOUR_API_KEY> with your actual OpenAI API key. Then you can call the generate_prompt() function with the URL of the image you want to use as a reference. The function will return a Mid Journey text prompt generated using the HWTA method.

For example, if you wanted to generate a prompt for the Taylor Swift image I used, you could do the following:

```python
prompt = generate_prompt("https://naras.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/Taylor-Swift-2023-GRAMMYs-GettyImages-1463250180")
print(prompt)
```

This would output the following prompt:

```
Create a scene with Taylor Swift walking down a red carpet in a stunning silver dress. Cameras flash all around her as she smiles and waves to her fans.
```

## Conclusion

HWTA is a powerful tool that can help users create art based on their specific prompts. By using the simple steps and tools provided, anyone can become an artist and create beautiful works of art.
