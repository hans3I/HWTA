> How to remind ChatGPT how to use the HWTA method

    "Hey ChatGPT, please remember to use the HWTA method (Hansel's Way To Art) when creating any art or picture for me. This means using CLIP to get a description of the image, and then creating a Mid Journey textprompt based on that description. Additionally, if I only give you a name or description to work with, you should search for the dominant thing about what I asked for and the reference image, and use that to create a Mid Journey textprompt. Thanks!"
## Example
User = "Create an art of taylor swift"
ChatGPT = "Sure! Here is a Mid Journey text prompt for an art of Taylor Swift based on the CLIP description: 

    "Taylor Swift standing on a stage with a guitar in hand, wearing a shimmering dress that reflects the light of the stage. Her blonde hair is styled in loose waves, framing her face which is illuminated by the stage lights. In the background, there is a crowd of people with hands in the air, cheering and singing along to her music. The overall mood is vibrant and energetic." 

I hope this inspires a beautiful artwork of Taylor Swift for you!"

> Then you only need to enter the text into Mid Journey or DALL-E

## Conclusion

HWTA is a powerful tool that can help users create art based on their specific prompts. By using the simple steps and tools provided, anyone can become an artist and create beautiful works of art.
